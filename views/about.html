  </div>
  <div class="modal-body">
<p>The Boxer Rebellion was a Chinese nationalist uprising in response to the Western powers imperialist policies within China. The focal point of the rebellion was centered on Peking (Beijing) and the foreign quarter of the city – the Legation. The Boxers and their sympathizers within the Chinese government had successfully besieged the quarter and would continue to do so for 55 days. An international coalition of great powers – United Kingdom, Unites States, Russian Empire, German Empire, Austria = Hungary, France, Italy, and Japan coordinated a relief force to rescue the foreigners trapped in Peking. Ultimately this rescue was successful but the Boxer rebellion had long-term consequences on the region. Specifically, the imperialist powers recognized that it would serve their interest to have the Chinese government – the ruling Qing dynasty – be formally supportive of their presence and policies. The cooperation of the Chinese Emperor with foreign powers during a critical period of political awakening amongst the Chinese population was a catalyst to increasing nationalist sentiment and Boxer influence can be seen in subsequent nationalist victories in China with the eventual collapse of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China.</p> 
    <p>Russian interest and influence in China came from geographic factors. Russia and China had demarcated their border common border by 1689 and for subsequent centuries, the Russian Empire afforded greater attention to events in the west. By 1900 this was no longer the case. The major breakthrough came with the acquisition of what is known in Russia as “Primorye” (Seaside) territory. This territory was acquired around the 1860s. Vladivostok, the major city in the Far East was founded in 1860, Blagoveshchensk – 1858. In the areas that Mordecai is serving in, Russia is a newcomer but it is an Imperial power that has all of the advantages of industrial technology vis a vis the Chinese.</p> 
    <p>The geography of Manchuria meant that it was always treated as a distinct province by imperialist powers. Manchuria consists of a central flatland with mountains and rivers defining the borders of the province. This meant that with sufficient resources, a foreign power could wrest control of the province from the Chinese government. The Russian Empire and later the Empire of Japan did just that.</p> 
<p>The Russian state gained control over the vast majority of Siberia fairly early. The problem for Russia, however, was that the majority of this land could not be effectively utilized or even navigated without industrial technology. This is due to a very inconvenient river system that flows North/South rather than East/West. The trans-Siberian railroad is the key to all of Russia’s efforts in the region and it is the primary reason that the Russian army could transport so many soldiers into Manchuria. Although construction started in 1891, and it wouldn’t be completed until 1916, by the time of the invasion there were enough completed segments between cities as to allow the efficient transport of men and material. Mordecai is operating in a region that has experienced a huge spike in interest from the Russian government and since construction of the railway began at both ends working inland, the Far East was hosting large numbers of various personnel from soldiers and laborers to new settlers and administrators.</p>
