      <p class="">In 1898, Mordecai Jacobovitch, A twenty-one year old Jewish Polish bookbinder, was conscripted into the 9th Rifleman’s Brigade of the Czar’s army. On June 26th 1900, Mordecai and his comrades were informed that they were to begin a march to Manchuria, part of Russia’s invasion that co-incided with the Boxer Rebellion. During their 10 month campaign they would travel over 8,700 miles first over land across Russia and Manchuria and then back to Russia first by sea through Singapore and then by land back Russia</p>

      <p>Mordecai and his fellow Jewish soldiers from Poland and Russia were both celebrated and cheated by their  fellow Jews in various villages along the way.  They were forced to fight on Yom Kippur, recognized fellow Jews in Singapore by the matzah crumbs in their beards during Pesach, survived several bouts of scurvy and other illnesses and had many other adventures throughout the campaign.</p>
      <p>This website is based on a translation of Mordecai’s diary or memoir of these events:</p>
